#Linear Regression
Definition:
Linear regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It is used for regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous.

*Advantages:*
Easy to interpret and implement.
Efficient for small to medium-sized datasets.
Provides insights into the relationship between variables.

*Disadvantages:*
Assumes a linear relationship between variables.
Sensitive to outliers.
Prone to multicollinearity if independent variables are highly correlated.
Use Cases:
Predicting continuous values like sales, temperatures, or stock prices.
Estimating trends in time series data.

#K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Definition:
KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It predicts the target variable based on the similarity of features (distance) to its nearest neighbors in the feature space.
â€‹
*Advantages:*
Simple and intuitive.
Effective for small datasets with a limited number of features.
No explicit training phase (lazy learning).

*Disadvantages:*
Computationally expensive for large datasets (high memory usage).
Sensitive to irrelevant or noisy features.
Requires feature scaling for optimal performance.

*Use Cases:*
Classification tasks like spam detection and handwriting recognition.
Regression tasks like predicting house prices.

#Logistic Regression
Definition:
Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary or multi-class classification problems. It predicts the probability that a data point belongs to a certain class.

*Advantages:*
Simple and interpretable.
Works well for binary and multi-class classification.
Outputs probabilities, providing confidence levels for predictions.

*Disadvantages:*
Assumes linear separability between classes.
Not effective for complex decision boundaries.
Sensitive to multicollinearity and outliers.

*Use Cases:*
Binary classification tasks like email spam detection, credit card fraud detection, or predicting disease presence.
Multi-class classification tasks like digit recognition.
